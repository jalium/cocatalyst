# cocatalyst

This repository presents a selection of data from a masters thesis project which can be accessed [here](https://ruor.uottawa.ca/handle/10393/38450).

The graphs below display the substrate consumed and metabolites produced by a novel coculture of *Propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii* and *Geobacter sulfurreducens*. This particular coculture was developed for use as an anodic biocatalyst in microbial fuel cells. Specifically, to address the low power generation that impedes the advancement of microbial fuel cell technology. While *Propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii* has shown potential as a biocatalyst, its incomplete consumption of the anodic substrate is a persistent issue. This project as a whole aimed to optimize substrate consumption to increase power generation using *Propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii* as a biocatalyst. The effect of coculturing *Geobacter sulfurreducens* with *Propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii* was investigated. The cocatalyst and pure culture performance was tested in an air-cathode microbial fuel cell and the metabolic data is presented in this repository. The novel cocatalyst was shown to produce electricity, however a full characterization to elucidate the contribution to power generation by each microbe would be desirable to investigate.
