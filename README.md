# cocatalyst

Addressing the low power generation of anodic biocatalysts is pertinent to the advancement of microbial fuel cell technology. While *Propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii* has shown potential as a biocatalyst, its incomplete consumption of the anodic substrate is a persistent issue. This project aimed to optimize substrate consumption to increase power generation using *Propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii* as a biocatalyst. The effect of coculturing *Geobacter sulfurreducens* with *Propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii* was investigated. The cocatalyst and pure culture performance was tested in an air-cathode microbial fuel cell and the metabolic data is presented in this repository. The novel cocatalyst was shown to produce electricity, however a full characterization to elucidate the contribution to power generation by each microbe would be desirable to investigate.
